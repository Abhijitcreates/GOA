The Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) is a nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization technique based on the swarming behavior of grasshoppers in nature. GOA mimics the social interaction and movement of grasshoppers to solve optimization problems. In GOA, grasshoppers explore the search space by balancing two phases: exploration and exploitation. Exploration helps in searching globally for potential solutions, while exploitation focuses on fine-tuning the best solutions found.

GOA has been successfully applied to various optimization problems in fields such as engineering, machine learning, and wireless communication systems. It is especially suitable for solving complex, nonlinear, and multimodal problems.
